This repository contains all Python code used to generate the torque-based hindlimb analyses, static sweeps, dynamic stride simulations, and sensitivity analyses presented in the manuscript:

“Quantifying Energy-Efficient Evolution in Cursorial Avian Archosaurs Through Comparative Torque-Based Hindlimb Modeling.”

The scripts implement a simplified 2-D torque framework for modeling the knee–ankle mechanics of Deinonychus antirrhopus and Struthio camelus, comparing energy-efficient postural evolution in bird-line archosaurs.
